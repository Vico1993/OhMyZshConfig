# Oh My Zsh Config

Here I save my ZSH config so I don't loose it again... For my MacOs Instalation at least!

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Vico1993/OhMyZshConfig.git .zsh
```

2. Create a link from your $HOME with the `.zshrc`

```shell
ln -s .zsh/.zshrc .zshrc
```
